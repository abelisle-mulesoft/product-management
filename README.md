# Product Management Microservice

This repository contains a microservice that manages products for Brilliant Mule's e-commerce website, a fictitious company. I designed and implemented this microservice to demo universal API management (UAPIM) on the MuleSoft Anypoint Platform.

## Implementation Overview
I designed and implemented the Product Management microservice using a top-down or contract-first approach, and authored its API specification using the Open API Specification version 3.0. Finally, I implemented it using the following technology stack:
- Java 11
- Spring Boot 2.7.18
- H2, the Java SQL database

The build creates a runnable JAR.

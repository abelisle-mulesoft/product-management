We leverage Anypoint Flex Gateway to manage and secure access to the Product Management microservice. To consume it:

1. Review the API Documentation

    First, consult this portal's ***API Summary*** section for details on the implemented resources, methods, and their expected behavior. As a reminder, you can use the API mocking service to simulate the behavior of the Product Management microservice and even leverage it to test your client application without requiring access to an API instance.

2. Request Access

    Then, you must register a client application and request access to one of the API's instances. Once submitted, a member of our support team will review your request. For more information, please refer to the article [Request Access](https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-exchange/to-request-access) in the Anypoint Exchange documentation.

3. Once Approved, Access the API

    Once we approve your request, you will receive an email confirmation. You can start accessing the API instance immediately using your registered application's client ID and client secret.

4. Please Provide Feedback

    We are always looking to improve our APIs and ensure consumers get value. We would appreciate any constructive feedback based on your experience working with the Product Management microservice.

## Prerequisites
As discussed on the *How to Consume API* and *Security* pages, you must register a client application and request access to one of the API's instances.

## Testing Your Application
Naturally, you can use the API mocking service to simulate the behavior of the Product Management microservice and even leverage it to test your client application without requiring access to an actual API instance. In the current version, we have not configured any specific scenarios or test data.
